I am a college student at University of North Dakota studying Health Education
I am currently working as a paramedic
I am beginning to learn about programming, AI, ML, Github and all the other things
I am interested in learning AI and ML because the new age of tech coming out is changing the world for the better
I want to learn how to create, utilize, and enhance my life/workflows. 


My goals are:
complete my coursework
create a digital portfolio
start contributing to open source projects
launch my own projects
make the world a better place
